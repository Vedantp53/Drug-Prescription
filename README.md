OUR IDEA : ------


To develop a framework of multiple AI models that can work in collaboration and reason with each other and form various paths (logical abstracts) to reach one certain decision.  

Focus on the medical prescription use case that involves reasoning for a disease diagnosis (like multiple doctor consultations).

A general-purpose framework and  an inference engine that describes how to manipulate and combine these facts

We also focus on how to leverage knowledge graphs in pre-model, in-model, and post-model AI models in healthcare to make them more explainable



CONCEPT OF SOLUTION : --


A Multi-Model Machine learning approach is needed for better reasoning.
        (Random Forest, LSTM,  Soft Voting )

The Target variable will be achieved with a voting classifier.

Knowledge graphs will visualize data such that related information is constantly connected which will help obtain in-depth insights into the underlying mechanisms of the working models 

SCOPE OF SOLUTION  :---


What is novel in your mentioned idea and the scope of the proposed solution

We are implementing multiple Machine Learning Models so that they provide better reasoning and predict prescriptions with higher accuracy.
Libraries of Voting Classifiers will be used to draw out the mean of all the machine learning models rather than the usual majority wins algorithms.
Knowledge Graphs will serve reasoning by providing a  visual representation of the mechanism of the models


PROS AND CONS OF THE SOLUTION :---


1.Combine siloed data sources
2. Combine structured and unstructured data
3. Insights from hierarchical data
4. Visualizing a ﬂow of information

1. Might Replace Human Employees
2. The threat of data loss
3. Errors may be injurious to the health of the population at large


VALIDATION : ----


1.Adding knowledge
  Providing More data to the ML algorithms 
2. Features selection
	Dimensionality Reduction
	Random Forest Libraries
3. Hyper Parameter Tunning
	K Means algorithm
	Trail and error

4.Ensemble Models
5.Outliners Detection
